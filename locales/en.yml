    title: THE TEAM
    body: 'We’re a team comprised by people who, unselfishly but with great passion, recorded over 3 months of performances at the WTF! Jam Sessions. We love live music, but we acknowledge how difficult is to stay on top with the passing of decades the way this “free-style” Mondays have done. We just wanted to try to capture a very small moment of its trajectory.'

Also with a great trajectory in the documentary genre, producing several music videos and a lot of other audiovisual products (spot's, commercials, dance videos, corporate...). AVED also offers formation and a workflow based on group singergies, an absolut and unapologetic passion for cinema."

    title: THE DOCUMENTARY
    body: "For 11 years, at the Jamboree in Barcelona, every monday jam sessions, known as WTF!, gather hundreds of musicians performing in these special jamming sessions. They go on stage, not knowing what will happen, without a script. It’s a jump to the void. Meanwhile, across the atlantic ocean, a Jupiter (Florida), one of the pioneers that played at the Jamboree 50 years ago, has began packing. Wally Besser, a 76 years old trumpeter, it’s about to get on a plane to go back to that iconic stage in the Ciutat Comtal. One more jump, this one, on time and straight into the memories of one Barcelona where a jazz musician could go on to perform 3 concerts in only 1 night."
